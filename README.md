Tasks for WnCC Convenership 

I respect the code of honor and declare that all the files in this repo have been written and created by me.

I have done Task 1 and Task 3.
In Task 1, I used file stream to fetch the data from the file Schedule.txt and then implemented
the logic that is sorting by time and then taking the duration into consideration selecting
which all meets the person should take to maximize the number of events one can attend.

In Task 3, I used Canva to create an Instagram post which follows the WNCC's new theme of Purple.
(A lot of the posts on IG don't follow this theme but uniformity is better imo.) The post is on
Planned Obsolesence of iPhones and how Apple used to slow down older iPhones to force users to
upgrade. But now, Apple has acknowledged this and implemented Right To Repair. This will soon
cause other companies to follow.
